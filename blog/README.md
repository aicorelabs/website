This folder contains individual blog post HTML files.

## Adding a New Blog Post

1. **Copy the template**: Use `how-we-built-ai-mvp.html` as a template for new posts
2. **Create a new file**: Use a descriptive filename like `your-post-title.html`
3. **Update the content**:
   - Change the `<title>` and meta description
   - Update the category tag
   - Update the author info if needed
   - Replace the blog content
   - Update the related posts section
4. **Add to blog.html**: Link to your new post from the main blog page

## File Naming Convention

Use lowercase with hyphens:
- ✅ `how-we-built-ai-mvp.html`
- ✅ `10-mvp-mistakes.html`
- ❌ `How We Built AI MVP.html`
- ❌ `blog_post_1.html`

## Important Notes

- All asset paths should use `../assets/` (relative to blog folder)
- All page links should use `../page.html` (relative to blog folder)
- Keep the same styling and structure for consistency
